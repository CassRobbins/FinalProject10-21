    <p>Welcome to my website for a specific niche. If you happen to be in the party of those that love Skyrim and would like to adapt it to Dungeons and Dragons, you've come to the right place. I'd like to note that I don't have the rights to either of these properties, The Elder Scrolls series, namely The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is owned by Bethesda Softworks LLC and Dungeons & Dragons is owned by Wizards of the Coast LLC. This is a non-profit project for the purpose of fun.
    With all that said, I've come to fall in love with The Elder Scrolls but after 10 years, I think it's high time to begin writing new stories and quests. My goal with this is to create a resource for other Dungeon Masters (DM's) to create their own stories within The Elder Scrolls universe, with the enemies and characters we've all come to love. So please, take some time to explore and see if you feel inspired!
